# Projet_Piscine

This project was the first group project of first year in Polytech.
It's purpose was to mix people that didn't know eachother and were 
in different schools the year before to try to learn fast from eachother.

The project given to our class was to create a website for a cooking teacher.
He told us his needs and we needed to answer the best to his needs with a website app.

We chose PHP because most of the group hadn't done any web programming in the past 
and the others knew PHP, we thought it would be the best solution for them to learn fast
even if PHP is not the best choice in general, the situation made it the best we could do.
